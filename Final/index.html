<h2>The letters 'PC' stand for 'personal computer' â€“ that is, a computer that can fit on a single desk for use by ordinary people, as opposed to a huge mainframe or supercomputer.Although the acronym technically refers to any such computer, it has come to mean the multi-purpose machines that usually run the Microsoft Windows operating system, as opposed to the Macintosh machines made by Apple.Building your first PC is an intimidating process, you have to pick the right PC components, put everything in the right slots all while worrying about damaging expensive equipment. However, not only has building a PC become such a plug-and-play process, but we here at TechRadar will show you the right steps, so you can be sure your computer will work like a charm. </h2>
