<p>First you open the case,lay the case in your work area and remove the side panel that provides access to the interior. For most cases, this means the left-side panel (as viewed from the front). Also remove anything that is dangling inside the case, or if it is attached, push it aside. Many cases have permanent internal wiring that can become a hassle later.</p>
<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Know where to buy components. In-store locations such as Best Buy will stock computer components, but you can usually find comparable parts for cheaper if you shop online. Common online locations include Amazon, eBay, and NewEgg. </p>
