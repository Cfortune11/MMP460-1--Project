<h1>Step 3 - Installing the Processor</h1>
<p>We are going to prepare the motherboard by installing the CPU, cooler, and RAM before fitting it in the case. Its is a lot easier to install them now, rather than after the motherboard is installed in the system. In fact, depending on your case and cooler, it may not be possible to assemble your system with the motherboard in the case. Thats because many after-market coolers use a backplate to provide the tightest fit possible. It is, of course, attached to the back of the motherboard. You will not be able to install it unless you have a case with a cut-out that aligns with the backplates location, a feature typically found only in high-end enclosures. Carefully remove the motherboard from its anti-static bag and set it on a hard, flat, non-metal surface such as a wooden desk, or the top of the motherboard box itself. Also, make sure that there are no sources of dust or liquid nearby.</p>
